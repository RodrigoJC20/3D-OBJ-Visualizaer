# OBJ Reader

This is a simple .obj reader written in C++ using OpenGL. The program reads .obj files and renders them on the screen in color, without textures or shadows.

## Animations

The program supports basic animations such as rotation and bezier curve. Here's an animated GIF of the rotation animation in action:

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to add support for shadows and keyboard controls to enhance the user experience. Stay tuned for updates!
